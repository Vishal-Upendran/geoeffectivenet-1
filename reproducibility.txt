There could be slight differences in the results depending on the GPU hardware/drivers and CPU being used. This is because there is some measure of error associated with GPU codes.
Since our workflow is massively complicated, we would expect some minute differences in the results while we re-run the code. This is expected, and a task for the future to be fixed.
